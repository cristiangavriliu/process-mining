        <h4>Process mining</h4>
        <p>Process mining is a data-driven approach to improving and optimizing business processes. It involves
            analyzing and visualizing data from process logs to identify inefficiencies and opportunities for
            improvement. By using techniques such as process discovery, process conformance, and process
            enhancement, process mining can help organizations understand and improve their processes, leading to
            increased efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

        <h4>Process discovery</h4>
        <p>Process discovery is a process mining technique that involves automatically constructing a process model
            from process logs. It allows organizations to uncover hidden or implicit processes and understand how
            they are actually being carried out.</p>

        <h4>Alpha Miner</h4>
        <p>One example of a process discovery tool is the Alpha Miner, which is a specific algorithm that can be
            used to discover process models from event logs. It is based on the Alpha algorithm, which is a
            well-known process discovery algorithm that uses heuristics to discover process models from event logs.
            The Alpha Miner is a variant of the Alpha algorithm that has been specifically designed for discovering
            process models from event logs with a high level of noise and incompleteness.</p>

        <p>In summary, process mining is a data-driven approach to improving and optimizing business processes, and
            process discovery is a technique
